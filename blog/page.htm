<p> And here it is, the site is finally launched. It is written in pure HTML and looks simple (not primitive). I made the site the way I want to see sites on the Internet, simple. It will contain information about the projects I am involved in, some moments from my life and other information that might be interesting to someone). Welcome to my site! </p>
