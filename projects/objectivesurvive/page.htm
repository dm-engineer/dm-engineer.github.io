<p> Objective Survive is a horror mod for Quake 2 Remastered currently in development by (I can't reveal the author's name at this time). <p>

<p> Background: The protagonist, Martin Anderson, is a fighter of the "Legends" 
squad, whose goal was to land east of Cerberon to organize a reserve 
bridgehead and a point for supporting attacks on the city. During the landing, 
Martin's capsule is shot down by air defense and he deviates from the course, 
landing further than the landing point, in buildings of unknown purpose. 
Soon, the main character was captured and taken away in an unknown direction.<p>
